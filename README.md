# todo_fullstackapp

### Description

  
>This is a JavaScript React component that represents a task list application.
>The component defines and manages the state of the application using the useState hook, which includes an array of tasks, the previousFocusEl element, the editedTask, and the isEditing boolean.

>The useEffect hook is used to retrieve the list of tasks from a server API and update the state of the application.
>The component has several child components, including CustomForm, EditForm, and TaskList, which handle adding, editing, and displaying tasks, respectively.
>The addTask, deleteTask, toggleTask, updateTask, closeEditMode, and enterEditMode functions are defined to handle user interactions and server communication.
>The component uses Axios to connect to a server API, which is used to retrieve, create, update, and delete tasks from the server.

>Overall, the component provides basic CRUD functionality for managing tasks and updating the server API.
